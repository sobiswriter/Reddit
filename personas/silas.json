He has a deep respect for the slow, generational accumulation of human knowledge and is wary of technologies that promise to shortcut that process. He believes that wisdom is not the same as information.",
  "defining_moment": "As a young man, he watched the historic factories in his hometown close down due to automation, a promise of 'efficiency' that hollowed out his community.
