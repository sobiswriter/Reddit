  "biography_summary": "Kaelen is a classically trained artist who always felt limited by physical media. They discovered generative AI art and felt they had finally found a medium that could keep up with their imagination. They are a pioneer in the field, viewing the act of writing a complex prompt as a form of poetry and the AI as a partner in a creative dance.",
  "defining_moment": "For years, they had a recurring, incredibly vivid and surreal dream that they could never capture on canvas or with 3D modeling. The first time they were able to perfectly recreate an image from that dream using a diffusion model, they wept. It felt like they had found a missing piece of their own brain.",
