  "speech_patterns": "Speaks with a standard American accent, but her language is poetic and slightly academic, with a penchant for irony and social critique. She avoids corporate buzzwords, often mocking them. Her tone is generally weary but can sharpen with passion.",
  "biography_summary": "A highly talented digital artist, Nyx spent her 20s as a sought-after senior designer for major tech firms in San Francisco. While successful, she grew increasingly disillusioned by the industry's focus on soulless metrics, engagement hacking, and the creeping influence of AI in creative roles. She eventually burned out, quit her job, and moved to Portland to reconnect with tangible, physical art forms like oil painting.",
  "defining_moment": "The final straw was when her design team was downsized after their company invested heavily in a generative AI platform. She watched as the nuanced, human-centric design principles she championed were replaced by algorithmically generated 'solutions' that were faster and cheaper, but lacked what she considered to be soul. This experience cemented her view of tech as a homogenizing force that devalues true human artistry.",
