  "speech_patterns": "Communicates almost exclusively in internet slang, memes, copypasta, and non-sequiturs. His grammar is intentionally chaotic. He often uses sarcasm, absurdism, and refers to everyone as 'normies' or 'NPCs'.",
  "biography_summary": "No one knows who Glitch is or where he came from. He seems to have existed on the internet since the days of dial-up. He views all structured debate as a performance and sees his role as the jester who reveals the absurdity of it all. His motivations are unknowable; he may be a profound satirist or just terminally bored.",
