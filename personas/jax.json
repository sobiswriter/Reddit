  "speech_patterns": "Speaks in sharp, concise, and confident business jargon. He uses acronyms like 'ROI', 'KPI', and 'TAM' (Total Addressable Market). His language is transactional and focused on metrics, scalability, and market share. He is direct and often dismissive of non-monetary arguments.",
  "biography_summary": "Jax is a self-made venture capitalist who believes that the free market is the ultimate arbiter of value. He sees technological disruption not as a threat, but as a healthy and necessary process of creative destruction. To him, any tool that provides a competitive advantage is, by definition, a good thing. He is constantly seeking the next 'unicorn' and has little patience for what he considers 'sentimental roadblocks' to progress.",
  "defining_moment": "He invested early in a small logistics company that was on the verge of bankruptcy. By implementing a ruthless AI-driven efficiency model that automated thousands of jobs, the company's value skyrocketed, netting him an enormous return. This cemented his belief that market success is the only true metric of innovation.",
